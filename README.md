# The Impact of Deep Learning in Grammar Correction

Grammatical Error Correction(GEC) refers to detecting
poor grammar and correcting it accordingly. These errors include spelling, incorrect use of articles, prepositions, pronouns,
nouns, and poor sentence correction.In recent years, NLP has made significant advancements due to the integration of various ML and DL models.
This helps propel the field of Grammatical Error Correction to
new heights and opens doors to various innovative applications
in language processing. This work shows the application of the
T5 model to correcting grammatical errors and compare it to
pre-existing models and architectures.


## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this task is the NAIST Lang-8
Corpus of Learner English, refined for the 14th BEA Shared
Task. It contains texts written by English learners, which may
include non-native speakers of English. As soon as the learners
write a passage in a language they are learning, the native
speakers correct it. It is a data set used for research and
evaluation in NLP and the acquisition of a second language
or SLA. The corpus is designed to support research on
language learning and error detection in learners of English.
The corpus is often used as part of the BEA Shared Task,
where participants develop and evaluate NLP systems for
various language-related tasks, such as error correction and
grammatical error detection. The corpus consists of texts
written by language learners who used the Lang-8 platform to
practice their writing skills. The NARA Institute of Science
and Technology (NAIST) makes the corpus publicly available
for the 14th BEA Shared Task
The dataset is accessible through the
